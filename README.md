# Big Data Project Investigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Economy

In this analysis, we leverage R programming language to examine how a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases impacts the economic activity of three different countries- the United States, Canada, and Germany. We use stock indices prices (Table 1) as a proxy for assessing these countries' economic activity. We then perform statistical analyses to determine the correlation between these countriesâ€™ economic activity, first measured as percentage difference and then as percentage change in daily stock index prices and the reported COVID-19 cases in the respective countries.
